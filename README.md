# Controling-a-2DOF-arm-using-PID-controllers-in-a-desired-path
A two-link planar robotic arm modeled in SolidWorks and simulated in MATLAB Simulink using Simscape Multibody. The project focuses on implementing PID controllers for accurate trajectory tracking through inverse and forward kinematics.
